## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a social links profile page based on provided designs and get it looking as close to the design previews as possible.

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements (the social links/buttons) on the page.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic Responsive Design principles
- Git & GitHub workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project applying HTML and CSS concepts, and it was a great learning experience. Some key takeaways include:

- **Structuring Content:** How to structure the HTML semantically using tags like `<main>`, `<img>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, and `<a>`.
- **CSS Variables:** Using CSS custom properties (`:root`) to manage colors and fonts efficiently, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
- **Layout Techniques:** Applying basic Flexbox (`display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`) on the `<body>` to easily center the main content card vertically and horizontally.
- **Styling Interactive Elements:** Implementing `:hover` and `:focus` pseudo-classes to provide visual feedback on interactive elements like buttons, enhancing user experience. I also used `transition` for smoother visual effects.
- **Working with Fonts:** Learning how to use `@font-face` to load custom fonts provided locally within the project assets, including specifying different font weights.
- **File Paths:** Understanding how relative paths work for linking CSS (`<link>`), images (`<img>`), and fonts (`url()` within `@font-face`) depending on the file structure.
- **Basic Git Workflow:** Practicing the fundamental Git commands (`git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) and connecting a local repository to GitHub. Managing file moves within Git.


### Continued development

For future projects, I'd like to focus on:

- Deeper Responsive Design: Using media queries more extensively to fine-tune layouts for different screen sizes beyond the basic mobile/desktop distinction.

- Advanced CSS: Exploring CSS Grid for layout, more complex selectors, and perhaps CSS animations.

- Accessibility: Learning more about ARIA attributes and best practices to ensure websites are usable by everyone.

- JavaScript: Starting to incorporate JavaScript to add more dynamic interactions to web pages.
